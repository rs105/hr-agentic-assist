## **HR-ASSIST Agentic AI System**
---

**HR-ASSIST** is an Agentic AI-powered system that automates core HR workflows, designed to streamline and modernize human resource operations‚Äîstarting with employee onboarding. Built on the FastMCP agent framework, this system enables autonomous task completion by integrating domain-specific tools such as employee management, leave tracking, ticketing, and meeting scheduling.

This project showcases a fully modular, extensible MCP server that works seamlessly with the Claude Desktop MCP client to automate HR operations with natural language prompts and custom tools.

- Tool interfaces for adding employees, applying leave, managing tickets, scheduling meetings, and sending emails.
- Prompt orchestration for higher-level agent behavior, such as onboarding.
- Integration-ready setup for Claude Desktop as the client.

> The Claude Desktop UI facilitates interaction, while the MCP server handles logic, data flow, and execution through defined tools.
